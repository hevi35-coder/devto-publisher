# Mastering the Art of Micro-Goals: How to Ship Side Projects 🚀

If you’re anything like me, you’ve got a dozen side projects brewing in your head—or maybe scribbled on sticky notes scattered across your desk. A killer app idea here, a portfolio redesign there, and oh, wouldn’t it be cool to build that game you dreamt about last year?

But here’s the harsh reality: *most of our side projects never see the light of day.* Why? Because we’re terrible at managing scope. (I’m looking at you, "I’ll just add a quick settings page... and maybe a dark mode while I’m at it.") Scope creep is the silent killer of creative flow—like a sneaky bug that crashes your whole system. Let’s talk about why this happens and how you can fix it.

## The Problem: Why We Fall Into the Scope Creep Trap 🌀

You start your side project with a spark of inspiration. You tell yourself, “I’ll just build an MVP!” But within a week, you’re knee-deep in refactoring the authentication flow, designing pixel-perfect animations, and setting up CI/CD pipelines. Instead of shipping *something*, you’ve built *nothing*. 

And let’s not forget how overwhelming the whole thing feels. You sit down to work, but your brain is flooded with a million disconnected tasks. "Do I start with the database schema? Or should I prototype the UI first? Wait, what’s the best library for this again?" Cue decision paralysis. 🤯

The result? Burnout, frustration, and an ever-growing graveyard of unfinished projects.

Here’s the truth: most of us try to tackle our side projects like they’re monoliths. We think in terms of huge deliverables—like "Build the app"—instead of breaking them into manageable, bite-sized pieces. And that’s where everything falls apart.

## The Solution: Think Small with the 9x9 Grid 🧩

What if I told you that the secret to actually shipping your side project is to *think smaller*? Like, *tiny*. I’m talking about breaking your project into micro-goals so small they almost feel ridiculous. This is where the **Mandalart 9x9 grid** comes in.

### What’s the Mandalart 9x9 Grid?

💡 Imagine your side project as a big puzzle. The Mandalart 9x9 grid is your way of slicing that puzzle into 8 chunks—each one representing a sub-goal (like "Set up the database" or "Design the login page"). Then, you break *each of those chunks* into 8 even smaller steps. 

So instead of staring at an endless to-do list like "Build the app," you’ve got super-actionable steps like:

1. Write `users` table schema.
2. Set up database connection.
3. Test database with mock data.

And so on. Each micro-goal is so manageable you can knock it out in one sitting. And here’s the magic: as you check off those tiny tasks, you build momentum. Momentum = progress. Progress = shipping. 🚢

## The Tool: How MandaAct Brings the Mandalart 9x9 Grid to Life ⚙️

Now, I know what you’re thinking: "That sounds great, but how do I even *start* breaking a project into micro-goals?"

Enter **MandaAct**, the productivity app designed for visual thinkers and creators who want to turn their goals into actionable steps. Here’s how it helps:

### 1. **Mandalart Grid**: Visualize Your Goals
MandaAct uses the Mandalart 9x9 grid to help you break down your big ideas. You start by defining your *main goal*—the ultimate outcome you want to achieve. From there, the app prompts you to identify 8 sub-goals that will help you reach that outcome. 

Are you building an app? Your sub-goals might look like this:
- Define the MVP.
- Design the UI.
- Set up authentication.
- Build the database schema.
- Implement core features.
- Write tests.
- Launch a landing page.
- Deploy to the cloud.

Each sub-goal is then broken down further into 8 actionable tasks, creating a clear roadmap for your project. The grid makes it easy to see the relationship between your core goal, sub-goals, and daily actions.

### 2. **Daily Action Checklists**: Stay Focused on Execution
Once your 9x9 grid is set up, MandaAct’s **Today’s View** helps you focus on what needs to be done *today*. The app generates a clean checklist of tasks based on your grid, so you can work through your goals step by step. No more decision paralysis or wondering what to tackle next—just open the app and start checking off tasks.

### 3. **AI Recommendations**: Get Unstuck
Feeling stuck on how to break down a sub-goal? MandaAct’s AI feature suggests actionable steps to help you fill in the grid. Whether you’re unsure how to start or need inspiration, the AI ensures you always have a clear path forward.

### 4. **Progress Reports**: Visual Feedback on Your Journey
MandaAct doesn’t just help you plan—it helps you track your progress. With built-in reports, you can see how consistent you’ve been and how far you’ve come. The visual feedback keeps you motivated and ensures you stay on track.

## Why the Mandalart 9x9 Grid Works: It’s Science, Baby 🧠

The Mandalart 9x9 grid isn’t just a productivity hack—it’s backed by psychology. Breaking big goals into smaller tasks helps reduce overwhelm and creates a sense of progress. Every time you check off a micro-goal, your brain releases a hit of dopamine, which motivates you to keep going. It’s like gamifying your side projects—except the final level is actually shipping the thing.
